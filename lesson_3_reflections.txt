**When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?** When you want to collaborate with others or if you would like to access this repo from different computers or locations.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?** Automatic pulls might over write work which have not yet pushed to a remote branch causing  you to lose work.
